# Medical-Insurance-EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis on medical insurance dataset — combining healthcare and financial perspectives to uncover cost drivers and demographic impacts.

This project analyzes a medical insurance dataset from both healthcare and financial perspectives.  
It explores how demographic and lifestyle factors (age, BMI, smoking status, region) influence insurance charges, and how these costs reflect broader financial implications.  

Key highlights:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory analysis with pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn
- Visualizations of healthcare factors (age, BMI, smoking) and financial outcomes (charges)
- Insights into the intersection of healthcare risks and financial costs
